I’ve done research in adversarial machine learning (on defenses against
adversarial examples and data poisoning) and theoretical computer science
(on spectral graph theory). 

I got my PhD in computer science from MIT, where I was advised by [Prof.
Aleksander Mądry](https://madry.mit.edu/). Before starting at MIT, I did Part
III of the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge University, with coursework in
combinatorics and algebra. And before that, I earned a BA, with a joint
concentration in math and computer science, at Harvard College, where I worked
with [Prof. Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/).

I’m also broadly interested in the research, design and implementation of tools
that make the work of scientists and practitioners in computational fields
easier, and their code simpler and more maintainable. As part of this, I'm
currently working on [mandala](https://github.com/amakelov/mandala), a Python
library to simplify scientific data management.
